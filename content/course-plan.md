## Week 1: Introduction

**Lecture:** You will be introduced to working with Python 3 (Anaconda, JupyterLab, VS Code). In order to show the power of numerical methods, we will: 1) solve a consumer problem, 2) simulate an AS-AD model.

**Class:** Work on DataCamp courses (free access will be provided):

1. Intro to Python for Data Science
2. Intermediate Python for Data Science
3. Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 1)
4. Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 2)

## Week 2: Fundamentals: Primitives

**Lecture:** You will be given an in-depth introduction to the **fundamentals of Python** (objects, variables, operators, classes, methods, functions, conditionals, loops). You learn to discriminate between different **types** such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples and dictionaries, and determine whether they are **subscriptable** (slicable) and/or **mutable**. You will learn about **referencing** and **scope**. You will learn a tiny bit about **floating point arithmetics**.

**Class:** Continue to work on DataCamp courses

## Week 3: Fundamentals: Optimize, print and plot

**Lecture:** You will learn how to work with numerical data (**numpy**) and solve simple numerical optimization problems (**scipy.optimize**) and report the results both in text (**print**) and in figures (**matplotlib**).

**Class:** Continue to work on DataCamp courses

## Week 4: Fundamentals: Random numbers and simulation

**Lecture:** You will learn how to use a random number generator with a seed and produce simulation results (**numpy.random**, **scipy.stats**), and calcuate the expected value of a random variable through Monte Carlo integration. You will learn how to save your results for later use (**pickle**). Finally, you will learn how to make your figures interactive (**ipywidgets**).

**Class:** Problem Set 1: Solving the consumer problem

## Week 5: Fundamentals: Workflow and debugging

**Lecture::** You will learn how to **structure** and **comment** your code and **document** it for later use. You will learn how to **debug** your code using print, **assert** and try/except statements. You will learn how to write **modules** and **run scripts** from a terminal in **VSCode** and how to share your code with others through **Git**.

**Class:** Problem Set 2: Finding the Walras equilibrium in a multi-agent economy 

## Week 6: Working with Data: Load/save and structure data

**Lecture:** You will learn to **load and save data** both to and from offline sources (e.g. CSV or Excel). You will learn about **pandas series and dataframes**, and how to clean, rename, structure and index your data. *Taugth by [Anders Munk-Nielsen](http://web.econ.ku.dk/munk-nielsen/default.htm)*.

**Class:** Problem Set 3: Loading and structuring data from Denmark Statistics

## Week 7: Working with Data: Basic data analysis

**Lecture:** You will learn how to **combine** (join and concatenate) datasets, **download online datasets** (throguh an API), and use **split-apply-combine** to calculate group-level statistics and make group-level plots. *Taugth by [Anders Munk-Nielsen](http://web.econ.ku.dk/munk-nielsen/default.htm)*.

**Class**: Problem Set 4: Analyzing data form Denmark Statistics

## Week 8:  Supervision on data analysis project

**Lecture:** Supervision on your data analysis project

**Class:** Work on your data analysis project

## Week 9: Algorithms: Searching and sorting

**Lecture:** You will learn how to write **pseudo code** and a bit about **computational complexity** (big-O notion). You will learn learn about **functional recursion** and some illustrative **search** (sequential, binary) and **sort** (bubble, insertion, quick) algorithms.

**Class**: Problem Set 5: Writing your own algorithms

## Week 10: Algorithms: Solving equations

**Lecture:** You will learn about working with matrices and linear algebra (**scipy.linalg**), including solving systems of linear equations. You will learn to find roots of linear and non-linear equations both numerically (**scipy.optimize**) and symbolically (**sympy**).

**Class**: Problem Set 6: Solving the Solow Model

## Week 11: Algorithms: Numerical optimization

**Lecture:** You will learn to solve non-convex multi-dimensional optimization problems using numerical optimization with multistart and nesting (**scipy.optimize**). You will learn simple function approximation using linear interpolation (**scipy.interp**). 

**Class**: Problem Set 7: Solving the consumer problem with income risk

## Week 12: Further Perspectives: The need for speed

**Lecture:** You will learn how to time your code and locate its bottlenecks. You will learn how to alleviate such bottlenecks using techniques such as **comprehensions**, **generators**, **vectorization** and **parallelization**. You will be introduced to how  to use the **Numba** library to speed-up your code. You will hear about the fundamental computational costs of mathematical operations and memory management (caching), and see how to call programs written in **C++** (ctypes) for optimal speed.

**Class**: Work on your model analysis project

## Week 13: Further Perspectives: R and MATLAB

**Lecture:** Two guest lectures will introduce you to the programming languages **MATLAB** (*taught by [Thomas Høgholm Jørgensen](http://www.tjeconomics.com/)*) and **R** (*taught by [Rémi Piatek](http://web.econ.ku.dk/piatek/)*).

**Class:** Work on your model analysis project

## Week 14: Further Perspectives: Julia

**Lecture:** A guest lecture will introduce you to the (up-and-coming) programming language **Julia** (*taught by [Andreas Noack Jensen](https://github.com/andreasnoack)*).
